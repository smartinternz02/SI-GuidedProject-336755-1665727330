Ship Classification using IBM Watson
ABOUT PROJECT: ABOUT PROJECT : In this project, we introduce a new convolutional neural network classification algorithm capable of classifying five classes of ships, including cargo, military, carrier, cruise and tanker ships, in inland waterways. All the images are present in a single folder so we will first be dividing them into categories with the help of a train.csv file that contains all the filenames of the training images. The model used to train the model is VGG16, a computer vision model which is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
